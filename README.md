# reddit's words of wisdom
Using Markov chains to generate sage advice from reddit comments. 
(Major work in progress)

Right now it essentially writes "Thou shalt not " + whatever it finds to come after "not" in the corpus it's given (the script to get text from a subreddit is included as well).
I might use node.js to make it a nice command line app once it's done, but for now it's just kinda fun to play with.
